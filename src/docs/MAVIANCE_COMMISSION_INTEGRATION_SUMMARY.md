# Maviance Commission Rate Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the Maviance deposit commission rate from the `rates` table into the `HebronConnectWalletTransactionService` to ensure accurate fee calculations for wallet transactions.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated HebronConnectWalletTransactionService
- **File**: `app/Services/HebronConnectWalletTransactionService.php`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `Rate` model import
  - Created `calculateFeeAmount()` method to get fee from Maviance rate
  - Updated `calculateMerchantAmount()` method to use actual Maviance rate
  - Modified all payment methods to use the new fee calculation
  - Added comprehensive logging for fee calculations

### 2. Fee Calculation Logic
```php
// Get Maviance deposit commission rate from rates table
$mavianceCommissionRate = Rate::getRateByName('maviance_deposit_commission');

// Convert percentage to decimal (e.g., 1.1% = 0.011)
$commissionDecimal = $mavianceCommissionRate / 100;

// Calculate fee amount
$feeAmount = $totalAmount * $commissionDecimal;

// Calculate merchant amount (total - fee)
$merchantAmount = $totalAmount - $feeAmount;
```

### 3. Current Maviance Commission Rate
- **Rate**: 1.1329% (from rates table)
- **Source**: `rates` table with name `maviance_deposit_commission`
