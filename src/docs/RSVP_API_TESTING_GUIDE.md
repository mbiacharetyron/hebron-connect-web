# RSVP API Testing Guide

## üß™ Overview

This guide provides comprehensive testing scenarios and examples for the Connect Room Event RSVP API. Use this to ensure your implementation works correctly and handles all edge cases.

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **Authentication Token**: Valid Bearer token for a user who is a member of a connect room
2. **Test Data**: 
   - At least one connect room with events
   - User should be a member of the room
   - At least one active event in the room

## üîß Setup

### Environment Variables
```bash
BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com/api/v1
AUTH_TOKEN=your_bearer_token_here
EVENT_ID=1
ROOM_ID=1
```

### Test User Requirements
- User must be authenticated
- User must be a member of the connect room
- Room must have at least one active event

## üéØ Test Scenarios

### 1. Basic RSVP Operations

#### 1.1 Create RSVP - Attending
```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/connect-room-events/$EVENT_ID/rsvp" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "status": "attending",
    "notes": "Looking forward to the event!",
    "guest_count": 1
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "RSVP successful",
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "status": "attending",
    "notes": "Looking forward to the event!",
    "guest_count": 1,
    "created_at": "2025-01-08T17:30:00.000000Z",

  }
}
```

## üîÑ Integration Testing

### 1. Complete RSVP Workflow

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# 1. Create RSVP
echo "Creating RSVP..."
RSVP_RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST "$BASE_URL/connect-room-events/$EVENT_ID/rsvp" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "status": "attending",
    "notes": "Looking forward to it!",

### 2. Activity Tracking Test

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# 1. Get room's last activity before RSVP
echo "Getting room activity before RSVP..."
BEFORE_ACTIVITY=$(curl -s -X GET "$BASE_URL/connect-rooms/my-rooms?sort_by=last_activity_at" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" | jq '.data.data[0].last_activity_at')

echo "Activity before: $BEFORE_ACTIVITY"

# 2. Create RSVP
echo "Creating RSVP..."
curl -s -X POST "$BASE_URL/connect-room-events/$EVENT_ID/rsvp" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "status": "attending",

echo "Activity after: $AFTER_ACTIVITY"

# 5. Compare timestamps
if [ "$BEFORE_ACTIVITY" != "$AFTER_ACTIVITY" ]; then
  echo "‚úÖ Activity tracking working correctly!"
else
  echo "‚ùå Activity tracking not working!"
fi
```

## üìä Performance Testing

### 1. Load Testing with Multiple RSVPs

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create multiple RSVPs concurrently
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/connect-room-events/$EVENT_ID/rsvp" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{
      \"status\": \"attending\",
      \"notes\": \"Load test RSVP $i\",
      \"guest_count\": 0
    }" &
done

wait
echo "All RSVPs created"
```

### 2. Response Time Testing

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Testing response times..."

# Test RSVP creation
echo "RSVP Creation:"
time curl -s -X POST "$BASE_URL/connect-room-events/$EVENT_ID/rsvp" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "status": "attending",
    "notes": "Performance test",
    "guest_count": 0
  }' > /dev/null

# Test RSVP retrieval
echo "RSVP Retrieval:"
time curl -s -X GET "$BASE_URL/connect-room-events/$EVENT_ID/rsvp" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" > /dev/null

# Test RSVP list
echo "RSVP List:"
time curl -s -X GET "$BASE_URL/connect-room-events/$EVENT_ID/rsvps" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" > /dev/null
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: 403 Forbidden
**Cause**: User is not a member of the room
**Solution**: Ensure user is added as a member of the connect room

### Issue: 404 Not Found
**Cause**: Event doesn't exist or is inactive
**Solution**: Verify event ID and ensure event is active

### Issue: Validation Errors
**Cause**: Invalid request data
**Solution**: Check request body against validation rules

### Issue: Activity Not Updating
**Cause**: Observer not registered or database issue
**Solution**: Verify observer is registered in AppServiceProvider

---

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues during testing:
1. Check the error response for specific details
2. Verify your authentication token is valid
3. Ensure you're a member of the connect room
4. Check that the event exists and is active
5. Review the validation rules for request data

For additional support, refer to the main API documentation or contact the development team.
