## Overview
Enhanced the connect room notification system to clearly specify the connect room in all notification messages and provide richer context information.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Notification Titles
All notification titles now prominently feature the connect room name and include relevant emojis for better visual identification:

  - `üì¢ New Announcement in {Room Name}`
  - `üí∞ New Contribution in {Room Name}`
  - `üìÖ New Event in {Room Name}`
  - `üîî New Activity in {Room Name}`

- **Member Notifications**:
  - `üë• New Member in {Room Name}`

- **Join Request Notifications**:
  - `üö™ Join Request for {Room Name}`
  - `‚úÖ Welcome to {Room Name}!` (approved)
  - `‚ùå Join Request Declined for {Room Name}` (declined)

- **Room Update Notifications**:
  - `‚öôÔ∏è Room Updated: {Room Name}`

- **RSVP Notifications**:
  - `‚úÖ Event RSVP in {Room Name}` (attending)
  - `‚ùå Event RSVP in {Room Name}` (not attending)
  - `‚ùì Event RSVP in {Room Name}` (maybe)

### 2. Improved Notification Bodies
Notification bodies are now more concise and focused, with the room context clearly established in the title:

- **Before**: "John Doe posted an announcement: Meeting Tomorrow in Tech Discussion Room"
- **After**: "John Doe posted: 'Meeting Tomorrow'"

### 3. Enhanced Notification Data
All notifications now include comprehensive room context information:

```json
{
  "connect_room_id": "123",
  "connect_room_name": "Tech Discussion Room",
  "connect_room_reference": "CR-0000123",
  "connect_room_join_code": "ABC123XYZ",
  "connect_room_category": "Technology",
  // ... other activity-specific data
}
```
