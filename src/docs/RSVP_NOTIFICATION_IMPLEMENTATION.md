# RSVP Notification Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully implemented notification functionality for Connect Room Event RSVPs. When members RSVP to events, notifications are automatically sent to room admins and the room owner.

## ✅ Implementation Summary

### 1. **Notification Service Enhancement**
- ✅ Added `sendRsvpNotification()` method to `ConnectRoomNotificationService`
- ✅ Targets admins and room owners (excluding the RSVP user)
- ✅ Customizes notification content based on RSVP status and guest count
- ✅ Includes comprehensive logging for debugging

### 2. **Event-Driven Architecture**
- ✅ Created `ConnectRoomEventRsvpReceived` event
- ✅ Created `SendConnectRoomEventRsvpNotification` listener
- ✅ Registered event-listener mapping in `EventServiceProvider`
- ✅ Implemented queued processing for better performance

### 3. **Controller Integration**
- ✅ Updated `ConnectRoomEventRsvpController` to fire notification events
- ✅ Added proper error handling and logging
- ✅ Maintains existing RSVP functionality while adding notifications

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Notification Service Method**
```php
public function sendRsvpNotification(ConnectRoom $connectRoom, $event, $rsvp, User $rsvpUser)
{
    // Get all admins and the owner (excluding the RSVP user)
    $adminIds = $connectRoom->admins->pluck('user_id')->toArray();
    $ownerId = $connectRoom->owner_id;
    
    // Combine and filter recipient IDs
    $recipientIds = array_unique(array_merge($adminIds, [$ownerId]));
    $recipientIds = array_filter($recipientIds, function($id) use ($rsvpUser) {
        return $id != $rsvpUser->id;
    });
    
    // Send Firebase notifications
    // ... notification logic
}
```

### **Event Structure**
```php
class ConnectRoomEventRsvpReceived
{
    public $connectRoom;
    public $event;
    public $rsvp;
    public $user;
    
    public function __construct(ConnectRoom $connectRoom, ConnectRoomEvent $event, ConnectRoomEventRsvp $rsvp, User $user)
    {
        // ... constructor
    }
}
```

### **Controller Integration**
```php
// After RSVP creation/update
event(new ConnectRoomEventRsvpReceived($event->room, $event, $rsvp, $user));
```

## 📱 Notification Content

### **Notification Title**
```
"New Event RSVP"
```

### **Notification Body Examples**
```
"John Doe responded Attending to "Team Meeting""
"Jane Smith responded Not Attending to "Company Retreat""
"Bob Wilson responded Maybe to "Project Kickoff" (+2 guests)"
```

### **Notification Data Payload**
```json
{
  "type": "connect_room_event_rsvp",
  "connect_room_id": "123",
  "connect_room_name": "Team Alpha",
  "event_id": "456",
  "event_title": "Team Meeting",
  "rsvp_id": "789",
  "rsvp_user_id": "101",
  "rsvp_user_name": "John Doe",
  "rsvp_status": "attending",
  "rsvp_notes": "Looking forward to it!",
  "rsvp_guest_count": "1",
  "timestamp": "1704729600",
  "action": "open_event_rsvps"
}
```

## 🎯 Target Recipients

### **Who Gets Notified**
- ✅ **Room Admins**: All users with 'admin' role in the room
- ✅ **Room Owner**: The user who created the room
- ❌ **RSVP User**: The person who made the RSVP (excluded)

### **Smart Filtering**
- Automatically excludes the person who made the RSVP
- Removes duplicate recipients (owner might also be an admin)
- Only sends to users with active device tokens

## 🔄 Notification Triggers

### **When Notifications Are Sent**
- ✅ **New RSVP**: When a member RSVPs for the first time
- ✅ **RSVP Update**: When a member changes their RSVP status
- ✅ **Guest Count Changes**: When guest count is updated
- ✅ **Notes Updates**: When RSVP notes are modified

### **When Notifications Are NOT Sent**
- ❌ **Non-members**: Users who aren't room members
- ❌ **Invalid events**: Events that don't exist or are inactive
- ❌ **Self RSVP**: When room owner/admin RSVPs to their own event

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### **API Request**
```bash
POST /api/v1/connect-room-events/123/rsvp
Authorization: Bearer {token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "attending",
  "notes": "Looking forward to the event!",
  "guest_count": 2
}
```

### **What Happens**
1. ✅ RSVP is created/updated in database
2. ✅ `ConnectRoomEventRsvpReceived` event is fired
3. ✅ `SendConnectRoomEventRsvpNotification` listener processes the event
4. ✅ Notifications sent to admins and room owner via Firebase
5. ✅ Comprehensive logging for monitoring

## 📊 Monitoring & Logging

### **Success Logs**
```php
Log::info('Connect room event RSVP notifications sent', [
    'connect_room_id' => $connectRoom->id,
    'event_id' => $event->id,
    'rsvp_id' => $rsvp->id,
    'rsvp_user_id' => $rsvpUser->id,
    'successful' => count($results['successful']),
    'failed' => count($results['failed'])
]);
```

### **Error Logs**
```php
Log::error('Failed to send RSVP notification', [
    'connect_room_id' => $connectRoom->id,
    'event_id' => $event->id,
    'rsvp_id' => $rsvp->id,
    'rsvp_user_id' => $rsvpUser->id,
    'error' => $e->getMessage()
]);
```

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test Coverage**
- ✅ Event firing verification
- ✅ Notification service mocking
- ✅ Different RSVP statuses
- ✅ Guest count handling
- ✅ RSVP updates
- ✅ Access control validation

### **Manual Testing Steps**
1. Create a connect room with admins and owner
2. Create an event in the room
3. Have a regular member RSVP to the event
4. Verify admins and owner receive notifications
5. Verify RSVP user does not receive notification
6. Test different RSVP statuses and guest counts

## 🔧 Configuration

### **Event Service Provider**
```php
protected $listen = [
    // ... other events
    ConnectRoomEventRsvpReceived::class => [
        SendConnectRoomEventRsvpNotification::class,
    ],
];
```

### **Queue Configuration**
- Listener implements `ShouldQueue` for better performance
- Notifications are processed asynchronously
- Failed notifications are logged for debugging

## 🎉 Benefits

### **For Room Administrators**
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Immediate notification when members RSVP
- ✅ **Event Planning**: Better visibility into attendance
- ✅ **Guest Management**: Know exactly how many people are coming
- ✅ **Status Tracking**: Monitor member engagement

### **For System Performance**
- ✅ **Asynchronous Processing**: Notifications don't block API responses
- ✅ **Efficient Targeting**: Only sends to relevant users
- ✅ **Comprehensive Logging**: Easy debugging and monitoring
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful failure handling

### **For User Experience**
- ✅ **Non-intrusive**: RSVP users don't get notified about their own actions
- ✅ **Rich Information**: Notifications include all relevant details
- ✅ **Actionable**: Notifications include action to open event RSVPs
- ✅ **Consistent**: Follows existing notification patterns

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### **Potential Improvements**
- 📧 **Email Notifications**: Send email summaries to admins
- 📊 **RSVP Analytics**: Track RSVP patterns and trends
- 🔔 **Custom Notifications**: Allow admins to customize notification preferences
- 📱 **Push Notification Settings**: Let users control notification frequency
- 📈 **RSVP Reminders**: Send reminders to members who haven't RSVP'd

## 📞 Support

The RSVP notification system is now fully integrated and ready for production use. All notifications are sent through the existing Firebase infrastructure and follow the established patterns for connect room notifications.
